Installing ETLyte is as simple as cloning the repository or unzipping the
archive.  There are, however, some prerequisites needed to run the program
which vary by platform.

### Linux
To run ETLyte on Linux, the Mono libraries are needed.  Install `mono-complete`
following the instructions from [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/) to add the repository and
install the libraries.

### Windows
Windows users will need to install
[.NET 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642)
and may also need to install the
[VC++ 2012u4  Redistributable](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/B/16B06F60-3B20-4FF2-B699-5E9B7962F9AE/VSU_4/vcredist_x86.exe)
